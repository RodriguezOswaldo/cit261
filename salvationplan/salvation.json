    "Premortal Life":"We exsited as individuals. We were members of Heavenly Father's Family, and He wanted us to have the opportunity to become like Him. We chose to follow Heavenly Father's plan to become like Him, and we accepted Jesus Christ as our Savior",
    "Creation":"",
    "Earth Life":"We receive a body and are tested. The test of obedience to our Father includes how we treat our brothers and sisters and how we use the powers given to us, including the godly power a man and a woman have to create life and raise and teach children in families",
    "Physical Death": "When you die, your spirit will enter the spirit world and await the resurrection. At the time of the resurrection, your spirit and body will reunite, and you will be judged and received into a kingdom of glory.",
    "After Life":" The glory you inherit will depend on the depth of your conversion and your obedience to the Lord’s commandments (see “Kingdoms of Glory,” pages 92–95). It will depend on the manner in which you have “received the testimony of Jesus”"
