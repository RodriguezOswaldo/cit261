        <h2>The story</h2>
        <img src="weds.jpeg" alt="wedding rings" title="wedding rings">
        <p>Laura and Ian were recently married and just moved into a new a
            partment with no furniture. After shopping at local thrift stores
            they have found a few things to furnish their apartment,
            but they haven’t found a bed or a couch. They decide to spend some
            extra money to purchase a high quality bed and a comfortable couch that will
            last for a long time. The local furniture store is offering special financing.
            If Laura and Ian are approved for the store financing, they pay nothing at the time
            of the purchase and they won’t have a payment due for six months.
        </p>

    <section class="section section2">
        <h2>The Temptation </h2>
        <img src="furniture.jpeg" alt="green couch" title="green couch">
        <p>The total bill for the couch, bed frame, and mattress they select,
            including taxes and the delivery fee, is <span class="bold">$2435.31.</span> Laura and Ian know th
            at taking on debt can have big consequences. After asking more questions ab
            out the furniture store financing, they learn the interest rate is <span class="bold">22%</span> and
            the minimum monthly payment is <span class="bold">$50.</span> They also learn that interest begins to acc
            rue at the time of the purchase. This means that interests accrues during the first si
            x months, even though they aren’t required to make payments.

        <h2>Lucidity</h2>
        <img src="finance.jpeg" alt="calculations" title="calculations">
        <p>As they looked at the amortization schedule, they noticed that during the first
            <span class="bold"> 6 months </span>their account balance would go up from <span class="bold"> $2435.31 to
                $2765.57. </span>
            This is an increase of more than <span class="bold">$330.</span> They also noticed that by <span class="bold">
                month 7</span>,
            the interest payments were slightly higher than the minimum payment of <span class="bold"> $50</span>.
            If they only paid the minimum payment, they would never pay off the loan.
            After two years they would have paid <span class="bold"> $900, but would still owe $2780.38.</span>
            They noticed that even after making payments for two years, they would
            still owe more than they originally borrowed.

        <h2>Because they knew better</h2>
        <img src="known.jpeg" alt="">
        <div class="p">
            <p> Laura and Ian decide the store’s financing offer was not a good choice.
                They had a personal credit card with a lower interest rate of <span class="bold"> 12%</span> that
                they could use. Using the payment (PMT) function in Excel they found that if they
                charged the new bed and couch to their credit card and made monthly payments of
                <span class="bold"> $114.64</span> they would have the furniture paid off in two years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on their calculations, Laura and Ian decided to purchase the new furniture using their credit
                card.
                They knew they made a wise decision not to use the store financing and were confident in their ability
                to pay off the credit card. They
                felt sure the lower interest rate on their credit card would save them a
                significant amount of money over the interest they would have paid for the store financing.
                They added monthly furniture payments of <span class="bold"> $114.64</span> to their budget.

        <h2>Madness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For the first two months, they faithfully made the <span class="green"> $114.64</span> payments on
                their credit card.
            </li>
            <li>Month #3 was December and they used their credit card to purchase Christmas gifts. In addition to
                adding to the card balance, they only made the minimum payment on the card instead of the <span class="green">
                    $114.64</span>
                they
                had planned.
            </li>
            <li>In January Laura noticed that Ian loved the amazing new TV their neighbors got for Christmas. Laura
                purchased the same TV for Ian’s birthday gift. It was even on sale. She charged the entire cost of the
                TV to the credit card.
            </li>
            <li>In February they overspent on eating out and a really expensive Valentines’ day dinner. They were only
                able to make the minimum payment on their credit card.
            </li>
            <li>In March they realized they were overspending and were careful to not add any new charges to the card.
                They made the planned payment of $114.64.
            </li>
            <li>In April, Ian used the credit card to purchase an expensive birthday gift for Laura. They only made the
                minimum payment on their credit card.
            </li>
            <li>For the rest of the year, they continued their pattern of overspending, not following their budget, and
                making only minimum payments on their credit card.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Over the first year, the balance on their credit card grew to <span class="bold">$4,537.</span>
            This was over the credit limit on the card and they were no longer able
            to use the card to make purchases. Because of the high balance,
            the minimum payment on the card increased. <em> Laura and Ian could no
                longer even make the minimum payment each month.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
                Laura and Ian found themselves in an unfortunate situation with long-term consequences. In addition to financial consequences,
                 like lowering their credit scores, their money situation brought added stress in their marriage. Their uncontrolled debt 
                 situation caused them to delay saving for retirement and starting their family. By taking on excess debt, Laura and Ian had 
                 made a significant financial mistake.
