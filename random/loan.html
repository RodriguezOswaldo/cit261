        <h2>The story</h2>
        <img src="weds.jpeg" alt="wedding rings" title="wedding rings">

        <p>Laura and Ian were recently married and just moved into a new a
            partment with no furniture. After shopping at local thrift stores
            they have found a few things to furnish their apartment,
            but they haven’t found a bed or a couch. They decide to spend some
            extra money to purchase a high quality bed and a comfortable couch that will
            last for a long time. The local furniture store is offering special financing.
            If Laura and Ian are approved for the store financing, they pay nothing at the time
            of the purchase and they won’t have a payment due for six months.

        <h2>The Temptation </h2>
        <img src="furniture.jpeg" alt="green couch" title="green couch">
        <p>The total bill for the couch, bed frame, and mattress they select,
            including taxes and the delivery fee, is <span class="bold">$2435.31.</span> Laura and Ian know th
            at taking on debt can have big consequences. After asking more questions ab
            out the furniture store financing, they learn the interest rate is <span class="bold">22%</span> and
            the minimum monthly payment is <span class="bold">$50.</span> They also learn that interest begins to acc
            rue at the time of the purchase. This means that interests accrues during the first si
            x months, even though they aren’t required to make payments.

        <h2>Lucidity</h2>
        <img src="finance.jpeg" alt="calculations" title="calculations">
        <p>As they looked at the amortization schedule, they noticed that during the first
            <span class="bold"> 6 months </span>their account balance would go up from <span class="bold"> $2435.31 to
                $2765.57. </span>
            This is an increase of more than <span class="bold">$330.</span> They also noticed that by <span class="bold">
                month 7</span>,
            the interest payments were slightly higher than the minimum payment of <span class="bold"> $50</span>.
            If they only paid the minimum payment, they would never pay off the loan.
            After two years they would have paid <span class="bold"> $900, but would still owe $2780.38.</span>
            They noticed that even after making payments for two years, they would
            still owe more than they originally borrowed.

        <h2>Because they knew better</h2>
         <img src="known.jpeg" alt="">
            <p> Laura and Ian decide the store’s financing offer was not a good choice.
                They had a personal credit card with a lower interest rate of <span class="bold"> 12%</span> that
                they could use. Using the payment (PMT) function in Excel they found that if they
                charged the new bed and couch to their credit card and made monthly payments of
                <span class="bold"> $114.64</span> they would have the furniture paid off in two years.</p>
