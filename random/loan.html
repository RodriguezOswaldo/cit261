        <h2>The story</h2>
        <p>Laura and Ian were recently married and just moved into a new a
            partment with no furniture. After shopping at local thrift stores 
            they have found a few things to furnish their apartment,
             but they haven’t found a bed or a couch. They decide to spend some 
            extra money to purchase a high quality bed and a comfortable couch that will 
            last for a long time. The local furniture store is offering special financing. 
            If Laura and Ian are approved for the store financing, they pay nothing at the time
             of the purchase and they won’t have a payment due for six months.

        <p>The total bill for the couch, bed frame, and mattress they select, 
            including taxes and the delivery fee, is <span class="bold">$2435.31.</span> Laura and Ian know th
            at taking on debt can have big consequences. After asking more questions ab
            out the furniture store financing, they learn the interest rate is  <span class="bold">22%</span> and 
            the minimum monthly payment is <span class="bold">$50.</span> They also learn that interest begins to acc
            rue at the time of the purchase. This means that interests accrues during the first si
            x months, even though they aren’t required to make payments.
